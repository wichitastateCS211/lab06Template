# Dynamic Array
This program will take arguments to the main() function. `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`

- The argument will be a positive number; you may assume it will alwys be a positive number.
- Using that number, we'll call it 'n', allocatte a dynamic array with a capacity of n elementst.
- Fill the array with multiples of 17 (17, 34, 51, ...).
- Print the array, with 20 elements per line.

## Hints
- `std::atoi()` from `<cstdlib>` will be necessary.
- When you borrow something remember to give it back.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_lab06.cpp
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
